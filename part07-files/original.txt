OMPi is a lightweight, open source OpenMP compiler and runtime system for C.
It sports an architecture that allows experimentation with a multitude of 
threading libraries while offering highly competitive performance.

The OMPi compiler takes C source code with OpenMP #pragmas and produces 
transformed multithreaded C code, ready to be compiled by the native compiler 
of a system. An optimized library is linked in the produced executable, 
providing efficient runtime support. It has been tested on a variety of Linux, 
Solaris, Irix and Windows (Cygwin) machines and can be easily ported to any 
machine supporting POSIX Threads.
